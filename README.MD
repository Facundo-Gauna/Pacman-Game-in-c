# Pacman Clone in C (SDL2)

Welcome to a complete, retro-style Pacman clone built in **C** using the **SDL2** library suite.
This project faithfully recreates the classic arcade experience, including ghost AI behavior, power pellets, scores, menus, and much more.

## High Score System

* Top 10 scores saved to `scores.bin`
* Players enter their name after each game
* Scores persist between runs

---

## Assets

* Font: [Press Start 2P](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Press+Start+2P)
* Sprites and sounds: Inspired by original Pacman, created manually or adapted

---

## Ghost AI Behavior

Each ghost uses a different strategy:

* **Blinky**: Follows Pacman directly
* **Pinky**: Targets 4 tiles ahead of Pacman's direction
* **Inky**: Double-vector chase using Blinky and Pacman's position
* **Clyde**: Chases Pacman but retreats when close

---

## TODO / Suggestions

* Add music support
* Add more reward animations
* Package as `.AppImage` or `.exe`
* Add level editor or multiple map support

---

Enjoy it.
